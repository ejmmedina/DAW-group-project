# Web Application for Rice Disease Image Classification
##### Data Applications (Web) final project by Justine Bu&ntilde;o & Elijah Justin Medina

This web application takes in image of rice leaves as an input and predicts the probability of the plant having the following diseases: Brown Spot, Hispa, and Leaf Blast. If the plant has a high probability of having one of the diseases, the corresponding tips and cure are shown as part of the result.

##### Model

The model used for the prediction is a neural network with 5 convolutional layers and 2 dense layers. Due to the size of the model, it is not included in this repository.

##### Deployment

The project is initially deployed on a personal domain (that has already expired), hosted using Amazon's EC2, Dash, and nginx.
